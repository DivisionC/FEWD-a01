FEWD assignment 1

## Introduction
I'm Brian, a former network engineer in the Navy.  I was responsible for all of the hardware that connected the entire computer network on the ship, as well as information assurance compliance and training.

While I was academically furthering my networking career there was one thing that surprised me.  I really enjoyed the little programming I was exposed to in class.  So I decided to jump ship and do something fun - code!  I have a very limited amount of web design experience but I am familiar with C++, Visual Basic and HTML.

Initially, I want to create a web page for the pinball club I manage.  We have many members and some refuse to use Facebook, which is our primary means of communication.  It's clear we need something outside of social media.  If I still enjoy coding after that I plan to fully transition from network engineer to web designer!

## Things I Enjoy
* Pinball
* Poker
* Pontiacs

Here's a picture of my friend who designs pinball machines:
